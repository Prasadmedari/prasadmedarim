    "## 1.Pass by value -\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass by value means that a copy of the actual parameter’s value is made in memory, i.e. the caller and callee have two independent variables with the same value. If the callee modifies the parameter value, the effect is not visible to the caller.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Difference Between Pass by Value and Pass by Reference\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "* Pass by value refers to a mechanism of copying the function parameter value to another variable while the pass by reference refers to a mechanism of passing the actual parameters to the function. Thus, this is the main difference between pass by value and pass by reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Changes\n",
    "* In pass by value, the changes made inside the function are not reflected in the original value. On the other hand, in pass by reference, the changes made inside the function are reflected in the original value. Hence, this is another difference between pass by value and pass by reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Actual Parameter\n",
    "* Moreover, pass by value makes a copy of the actual parameter. However, in pass by reference, the address of the actual parameter passes to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Association with Function\n",
    "* Another difference between pass by value and pass by reference is that, in pass by value, the function gets a copy of the actual content whereas, in pass by reference, the function accesses the original variable’s content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory Requirement\n",
    "* Besides, the pass by value requires more memory than pass by reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Requirement\n",
    "* Time requirement is one other difference between pass by value and pass by reference. Pass by value requires more time as it involves copying values whereas pass by reference requires a less amount of time as there is no copying.\n",
    "\n",
